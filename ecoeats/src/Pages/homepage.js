  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <ol>
    <p> <span>College students often face challenges with food waste</span> due to tight budgets,
       busy schedules, and limited cooking skills. Leftovers are frequently discarded,
        leading to increased costs and environmental impact. Our project tackles this
         problem with an AI-powered app that helps students creatively repurpose leftover
          ingredients, promoting sustainability and saving money. </p>
          
          <p>
          <span>We are a team of four Computer Science students</span> who decided to take action against food 
          waste after realizing how often we and our peers were throwing away perfectly good ingredients.
          With a shared passion for sustainability and technology, we combined our skills to develop an 
          AI-driven solution that makes it easier for students to use what they already have in their 
          kitchens. We believe that by turning leftovers into opportunities, we can make a difference 
          both for students and for the environment.
          </p>
          <p>
          <span>EcoEats</span> uses AI to suggest creative and easy-to-follow recipes based on the ingredients 
          you have at hand, helping students save money, reduce waste, and learn more about cooking
          in a fun, accessible way. Whether youâ€™re new to cooking or simply trying to stretch your
          budget, our app is here to inspire and empower you to make the most out of your food.</p>
