# What is the problem you are solving and why is it a problem?
College students frequently struggle with food waste due to tight budgets, hectic schedules, and limited cooking skills. Leftover ingredients are often unused because students may not know how to repurpose them into new meals, leading to unnecessary waste, additional costs, and financial strain. This issue is compounded by the unavailability of user-friendly tools that can efficiently help students manage and utilize their leftovers. As a result, food waste not only impacts their budgets but also contributes to environmental problems. Our project aims to tackle this by developing an AI-powered app that helps students find creative ways to use leftover food, promoting both sustainability and financial savings.

# How is your proposed solution better or different from what exists today?
With the excess amount of applications that are made for food solutions, EcoEats is our solution as an application to combine these features. It aims to fill these gaps by providing a single platform that combines inventory management, personalized recipe suggestions based on specific leftovers, and community sharing features. We also introduce the help of AI, which can create unique recipes and allow users to collaborate on new recipes and better nutritional oversight.

# What work do you plan to do in the project?
Key steps:<br/>
**User Interviews and Surveys:** We will conduct interviews and surveys with potential users to understand their cooking habits and challenges with leftovers.<br/>
**Market Analysis:** We’ll review existing apps to identify their strengths and weaknesses, helping us determine what features our app should include.<br/>
**Wireframing:** Create wireframes to outline the app’s layout and features, focusing on inventory management and recipe suggestions.<br/>
**Frontend Development:** Use React Native to create a website, ensuring a user-friendly interface.<br/>
**Backend Development:** Set up a server with Node.js and Express to handle data management and user authentication, using MongoDB for storage.<br/>
**API Integration:** Connect to some API to provide users with a variety of recipes based on their leftovers.<br/>
**Functional Testing:** Ensure all features work as intended, such as inventory tracking and recipe suggestions.<br/>
**Iteration:** Adjust the app based on user suggestions to enhance usability and functionality.<br/>
**Documentation:** Prepare a document explaining the development process and user instructions.<br/>

# What human factors or human-computer interaction aspects will you address?
We will focus on creating a simple and easy to use user interface that improves usability for college students. By using principles of effective color theory, we’ll create an engaging and visually coherent interface. Clear layouts, accessible navigation, and thoughtfully chosen color schemes will reduce cognitive load and make the app more enjoyable to use, allowing users to easily manage leftovers and discover new recipes.
