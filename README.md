# What is the problem you are solving and why is it a problem?
College students frequently struggle with food waste due to tight budgets, hectic schedules, and limited cooking skills. Leftover ingredients are often unused because students may not know how to repurpose them into new meals, leading to unnecessary waste, additional costs, and financial strain. This issue is compounded by the unavailability of user-friendly tools that can efficiently help students manage and utilize their leftovers. As a result, food waste not only impacts their budgets but also contributes to environmental problems. Our project aims to tackle this by developing an AI-powered app that helps students find creative ways to use leftover food, promoting both sustainability and financial savings.

# How is your proposed solution better or different from what exists today?
With the excess amount of applications that are made for food solutions, EcoEats is our solution as an application to combine these features. It aims to fill these gaps by providing a single platform that combines inventory management, personalized recipe suggestions based on specific leftovers, and community sharing features. We also introduce the help of AI, which can create unique recipes and allow users to collaborate on new recipes and better nutritional oversight.

# Features Implemented
**Ability to List**  - Users are able to edit their own lists containing ingredients and/or groceries, updating what needs to be cooked and whatâ€™s left in the pantry.<br/>
**Easy & Engaging GUI/UI**  - Having the elements and overall look of our application be easy to navigate compared to other overwhelming and information heavy recipe sites. <br/>
**User Profiles**  - With the ability to create their profiles, they can personalise different aspects which could range from their dietary restrictions, preference in cuisine, cooking expertise etc.<br/>
**API**  - Using APIs to gather our recipes data, creating recipes from leftover ingredients that have detailed instructions.<br/>
**Scanning Receipts**  - Users can also scan their receipts so that the app can log their recent grocery purchases and give them different recipes based on the receipt. <br/>


# What human factors or human-computer interaction aspects will you address?
We focused on creating a simple and easy to use user interface that improves usability for college students. By using principles of effective color theory, we created an engaging and visually coherent interface. Clear layouts, accessible navigation, and thoughtfully chosen color schemes will reduce cognitive load and make the app more enjoyable to use, allowing users to easily manage leftovers and discover new recipes. The app also supports intuitive inputs (e.g., scanning grocery receipts) and provides clear visual cues for managing inventory.
